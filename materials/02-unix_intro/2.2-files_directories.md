- Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.
- Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command.
- Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.
- Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
- Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files.
- Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories.

:::{.callout-tip}
### Keypoints:
- The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
- Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
- Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
- `cd path` changes the current working directory.
- `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
- `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
- `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
- A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
- An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
- Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows.
- `..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'.
- `cp old new` copies a file.
- `mkdir path` creates a new directory.
- `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.
- `rm path` removes (deletes) a file.
- `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
- `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
- The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
- Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
:::
:::::

## The file system
The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called "folders"),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory"). Directories are like *places* - at any time
while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called
our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. "here", so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu
```
:::

Here,
the computer's response is `/home/ubuntu`,
which is your **home directory**:

> ### Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.
> On Mac it may look like `/Users/ubuntu`,
> and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\ubuntu` or
> `C:\Users\ubuntu`.
>
> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
> In future examples, we've used Linux output as the default - Mac and Windows
> output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.

To understand what a "home directory" is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we'll be
illustrating the filesystem on a typical Linux computer.  After this
illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.

On a typical Linux computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![The File System](../fig/filesystem.svg)

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this is the leading slash in `/home/ubuntu`.

Inside that directory are several other directories:

- `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
- `usr` (for miscellaneous user files),
- `home` (where users' personal directories are located),
- `tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/home/ubuntu` is stored inside `/home`
because `/home` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/home` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

> ### Slashes
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name,
> it's just a separator.

Underneath `/home`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on the machine,
in this example *imhotep*, *larry*, and ubuntu (you).

![Home Directories](../fig/home-directories.svg)

The user *imhotep*'s files are stored in `/home/imhotep`,
user *larry*'s in `/home/larry`,
and yours in `/home/ubuntu`.  Because you are the current user in our
examples here, this is why we get `/home/ubuntu` as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in
your home directory to start.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`,
which stands for "listing":

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls
```
```
Documents    Downloads    Music        Public
Desktop      Movies       Pictures     Templates
```
:::

(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating
system and how you have customized your filesystem.)

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the `-F` **option**
(also known as a **switch** or a **flag**) ,
which tells `ls` to classify the output
by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:

- a trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory
- `@` indicates a link
- `*` indicates an executable

Depending on your default options,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
directory.

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F
```
```
Documents/    Downloads/    Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Movies/       Pictures/     Templates/
```
:::

Here,
we can see that our home directory contains mostly **sub-directories**.
Any names in your output that don't have a classification symbol,
are plain old **files**.

:::{.callout-tip}
### Clearing your terminal
If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the
`clear` command. You can still access previous commands using <kbd>↑</kbd>
and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line, or by scrolling in your terminal.
:::

## General syntax of a shell command
Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

```bash
ls -F /
```

![General syntax of a shell command](../fig/shell_command_syntax.svg)

`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-F` and an
**argument** `/`.
We've already encountered options (also called **switches** or **flags**) which
either start with a single dash (`-`) or two dashes (`--`), and they change the behaviour of a command.
Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.
A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument: but a
command doesn't always require an argument or an option.

Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between `ls` and `-F` the shell will look for a command called `ls-F`, which
doesn't exist. Also, capitalisation can be important: `ls -r` is different to `ls -R`. Also, `ls -s` is different to `ls -S`. Find out what each does.

Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
of files and directories in the **root** directory `/`.
An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F /
```
```
bin/  boot/  cdrom/  core  dev/  etc/  home/  home2/  initrd.img@  
initrd.img.old@  lib/  lib32/  lib64/  lost+found/  media/  mnt/  
opt/  proc/  root/  run/  sbin/  snap/  srv/  sys/  tmp/  usr/  var/
```
:::

## Getting help

`ls` has lots of other **options**. There are two common ways to find out how
to use a command and what options it accepts:

1. We can pass a `--help` option to the command, such as:

    ```bash
    ls --help
    ```

2. We can read its manual with `man`, such as:

    ```bash
    man ls
    ```

### The `--help` option

Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` option to display more
information on how to use the command or program.

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls --help
```
```
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
      --file-type            likewise, except do not append '*'
      --format=WORD          across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l,
                               single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C
      --full-time            like -l --time-style=full-iso
  -g                         like -l, but do not list owner
      --group-directories-first
                             group directories before files;
                               can be augmented with a --sort option, but any
                               use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping
  -G, --no-group             in a long listing, don't print group names
  -h, --human-readable       with -l and/or -s, print human readable sizes
                               (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
      --si                   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
...   ...                    ...     
```           
:::


:::::{.callout-warning}
### Unsupported command-line options
If you try to use an option (flag) that is not supported, `ls` and other commands will usually print an error message similar to:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -j
```
```
ls: invalid option -- 'j'
Try 'ls --help' for more information.
```
:::
:::::

### The `man` command

The other way to learn about `ls` is to type

```bash
man ls
```

This will turn your terminal into a page with a description
of the `ls` command and its options and, if you're lucky, some examples
of how to use it.

To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the `man` pages,
use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the character or word you are searching for.
Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits.  If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for moving forward) and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).

To **quit** the `man` pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.

:::{.callout-note}
### Manual pages on the web
Of course there is a third way to access help for commands:
Searching the internet via your web browser.
When using internet search, including the phrase `unix man page` in your search
query will help to find relevant results.

GNU provides links to its
[manuals](http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html) including the
[core GNU utilities](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html),
which covers many commands introduced within this lesson.
:::

:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Exploring More `ls` Flags
You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command `ls` do when used
with the `-l` option? What about if you use both the `-l` and the `-h` option?

Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such
as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful
nevertheless.

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
The `-l` option makes `ls` use a **l**ong listing format, showing not only
the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
and the time of its last modification. If you use both the `-h` option and the `-l` option,
this makes the file size "**h**uman readable", i.e. displaying something like `5.3K`
instead of `5369`.
<!-- FIXME: Add the exact outputs from a Linux PC to the solution -->
:::
:::::


:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Listing in Reverse Chronological Order
By default, `ls` lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical
order by name. The command `ls -t` lists items by time of last
change instead of alphabetically. The command `ls -r` lists the
contents of a directory in reverse order.
Which file is displayed last when you combine the `-t` and `-r` options?
Hint: You may need to use the `-l` option to see the
last changed dates.

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
The most recently changed file is listed last when using `-rtl`. This
can be very useful for finding your most recent edits or checking to
see if a new output file was written.
:::
:::::


## Exploring Other Directories

<!--FIXME: Edit this portion with the appropriate file and directory names respective to the Linux environment we will be using -->

Not only can we use `ls` on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory. Let's take a look at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`, i.e., the command `ls` with the `-F` **option** and the **argument**  `Desktop`.
The argument `Desktop` tells `ls` that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F Desktop
```
```
data-shell/
```
:::

Note that if a directory named `Desktop` does not exist in your current working directory, this command will return an error. Typically, a `Desktop` directory exists in your home directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash shell.

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your Desktop directory, including the `data-shell` directory.
On many systems, the command line Desktop directory is the same as your GUI Desktop.
Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate.

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files and directories are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Now that we know the `data-shell` directory is located in our Desktop directory, we can do two things.

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name as an argument to `ls`:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F Desktop/data-shell
```
```
creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/
```
:::

Second, we can also change our location to that directory, so we are no longer located in our home directory.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory", which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above.  We can use the following series of commands to get there:

```bash
cd Desktop
cd data-shell
cd data
```

These commands will move us from our home directory onto our Desktop, then into
the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory.  You will notice that `cd` doesn't print anything.  This is normal.  Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed. But if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/data`.
If we run `ls` without arguments now, it lists the contents of `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/data`, because that's where we now are:

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/data
```
:::

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F
```
```
amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/	        salmon.txt
animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt
```
:::

We now know how to go down the directory tree, but how do we go up?  We might try the following:

:::{.callout-warning}
### Error
```bash
cd data-shell
```
```
-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory
```
:::

But we get an error!  Why is this?

With our methods so far, `cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start with the simplest.

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level that looks like this:

```bash
cd ..
```

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one", or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough, if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell`:

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell
```
:::

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we want
to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` option:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F -a
```
```
./   .bash_profile  data/       north-pacific-gyre/  pizza.cfg  thesis/
../  creatures/     molecules/  notes.txt            solar.pdf  writing/
```
:::

`-a` stands for "show all"; it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`, such as `..` (which, if we're in `/home/ubuntu`, refers to the `/home` directory)

As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means "the current working directory". It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

:::{.callout-note}
Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
with a single `-` and no spaces between the options: `ls -F -a` is
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.
:::


:::{.callout-note}
## Other Hidden Files
In addition to the hidden directories `..` and `.`, you may also see a file
called `.bashrc`. This file usually contains shell configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning with `.`. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix `.` is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard `ls` command is used.
:::

These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer: `pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.

What happens if you type `cd` on its own, without giving a directory?

```bash
cd
```

How can you check what happened? `pwd` gives us the answer!

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/Users/name_of_user
```
:::

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've got lost in your own filesystem.

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

```bash
cd Desktop/data-shell/data
```

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your current location.

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location  from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash.  The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `data-shell` directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside `data`).  To find the absolute path we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need to move to `data-shell`.

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/data
```
:::

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell
```

Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

:::{.callout-note}
### Two More Shortcuts

The shell interprets the tilde (`~`) character at the start of a path to
mean "the current user's home directory". For example, for your home directory,`/home/ubuntu`, then `~/data` is equivalent to
`/home/ubuntu/data`. This only works if it is the first character in the
path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is *not* `here/there/home/ubuntu/elsewhere`.

Another shortcut is the dash (`-`) character. `cd` will translate `-` into *the previous directory I was in*, which is faster than having to remember, then type, the full path. This is a *very* efficient way of moving *back and forth between two directories* -- i.e. if you execute `cd -` twice,
you end up back in the starting directory.

The difference between `cd ..` and `cd -` is that the former brings you *up*, while the latter brings you *back*.

----
Try it!
First navigate to `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data` (you should already be there).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

Then `cd` into the `exercise-data/creatures` directory
```bash
cd exercise-data/creatures
```

Now if you run
```bash
cd -
```

you'll see you're back in `~/Desktop/data-shell`.
Run `cd -` again and you're back in `~/Desktop/data-shell/exercise-data/creatures`
:::

:::{.callout-important}
### Tab completion

Sometimes file and directory names get too long and it's tedious to have to type the full name for example when moving with `cd`. We can let the shell do most of the work > through what is called **tab completion**. 
Let's say we are in the `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/` and we type:

```bash
ls nor
```
and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>↹</kbd>(the tab key on the keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name:

```bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/
```

If we press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>↹</kbd> again, Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command, since it's the only possible completion. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>↹</kbd> again does nothing, since there are 19 possibilities; pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>↹</kbd> twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on. This is very useful in practise and we will see more of it later.

## ***Exercise:*** Absolute vs Relative Paths
Starting from `/home/amanda/data`,
which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory,
which is `/home/amanda`?

1. `cd .`
2. `cd /`
3. `cd /home/amanda`
4. `cd ../..`
5. `cd ~`
6. `cd home`
7. `cd ~/data/..`
8. `cd`
9. `cd ..`

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
1. No: `.` stands for the current directory.
2. No: `/` stands for the root directory.
3. Yes: This is an example of using the full absolute path.
4. No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in `/home`.
5. Yes: `~` stands for the user's home directory, in this case `/home/amanda`.
6. No: this would navigate into a directory `home` in the current directory if it exists.
7. Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.

## Creating directories
We now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we create them in the first place?

### Step 1: see where we are and what we already have
Let's go back to our `data-shell` directory on the Desktop and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

:::{.callout}
```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell
```
:::

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F
```
```
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
```
:::

### Step 2: Create a directory

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

```bash
mkdir thesis
```

As you might guess from its name, `mkdir` means "make directory".
Since `thesis` is a relative path (i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`), the new directory is created in the current working directory:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F
```
```
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  thesis/  writing/
```
:::

> Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

```bash
ls -F thesis
```

### Step 3: Create a text file
Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`, then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

```bash
cd thesis
nano draft.txt
```

> ### Which Editor?
>
> When we say, "`nano` is a text editor," we really do mean "text": it can

> another directory the first time you "Save As..."


Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or Control key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

![Nano in Action](../fig/nano-screenshot.png)

Once our file is saved, we can use `Ctrl-X` to quit the editor and
return to the shell. Note that pressing `Ctrl-X` without previously saving the file can achieve both aim of saving and exiting. You can try this out.

> ### Control, `Ctrl`, or `^` Key
>
> The Control key is also called the "Ctrl" key. There are various ways
> in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
> see an instruction to press the Control key and, while holding it down,

>
> * `Control-X`
> * `Control+X`
> * `Ctrl-X`
> * `Ctrl+X`
> * `^X`
> * `C-x`
>
> In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`.
> This means that you can use `Control-G` to get help and `Control-O` to save your
> file.

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls
```
```
draft.txt
```
:::

:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Creating Files a Different Way
We have seen how to create text files using the `nano` editor.
Now, try the following command:

```bash
touch my_file.txt
```

1.  What did the `touch` command do?
    When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer,
    does the file show up?

2.  Use `ls -l` to inspect the files.  How large is `my_file.txt`?

3.  When might you want to create a file this way?

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
1.  The `touch` command generates a new file called `my_file.txt` in
    your current directory.  You
    can observe this newly generated file by typing `ls` at the 
    command line prompt.  `my_file.txt` can also be viewed in your
    GUI file explorer.

2.  When you inspect the file with `ls -l`, note that the size of
    `my_file.txt` is 0 bytes.  In other words, it contains no data.
    If you open `my_file.txt` using your text editor it is blank.

3.  Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
    instead require that empty files have already been generated.
    When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to
    populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to
    efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such
    programs.

## Moving files and directories
Returning to the `data-shell` directory,

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/data-shell/
```

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt` which isn't a particularly informative name, so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for "move":

```bash
mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
```

The first argument tells `mv` what we're "moving", while the second is where it's to go. In this case, we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`, which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough, `ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls thesis
```
```
quotes.txt
```
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. 
:::

An additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
can be used to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

Note that `mv` also works on directories.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory. We use `mv` once again, but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second argument to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename,
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called "move".)
In this case, the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

```bash
mv thesis/quotes.txt .
```

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory (`.`).
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

```bash
ls thesis
```

Further, `ls` with a filename or directory name as an argument only lists that file or directory.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls quotes.txt
```
```
quotes.txt
```
:::

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`, except it copies a file instead of moving it. We can check that it did the right thing using `ls` with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands, `ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

:::{.callout}
```bash
cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
```
```
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
```
:::

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```bash
cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

We can check the result by listing the contents of both the `thesis` and `thesis_backup` directory:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls thesis thesis_backup
```
```
thesis:
quotations.txt

thesis_backup:
quotations.txt
```

## ***Exercise:*** Renaming Files
Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: `statstics.txt`
After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want tocorrect the mistake, which command could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
1. No.  While this would create a file with the correct name, the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory and would need to be deleted.
2. Yes, this would work to rename the file.
3. No, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names cannot be created.
4. No, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names cannot be created.
:::
:::::

:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Moving and Copying
What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?
You can try the commands starting from `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/protein-data`.

```bash
pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/protein-data
```
```bash
ls
```
```
proteins.dat
```
```bash
mkdir recombine
mv proteins.dat recombine/
cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
ls
```

1.   `proteins-saved.dat recombine`
2.   `recombine`
3.   `proteins.dat recombine`
4.   `proteins-saved.dat`

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
- We start in the `/home/ubuntu/protein-data` directory, and create a new folder called `recombine`.
- The second line moves (`mv`) the file `proteins.dat` to the new folder (`recombine`).
- The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.  

The tricky part here is where the file was copied to. Recall that `..` means "go up a level", so the copied file is now in `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell`.
- Notice that `..` is interpreted with respect to the current working directory, **not** with respect to the location of the file being copied. So, the only thing that will show using ls (in `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/protein-data`) is the recombine folder.

1. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell`
2. Yes
3. No, see explanation above.  `proteins.dat` is located at `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell/protein-data/recombine`
4. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/data-shell`
:::
:::::


## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `data-shell` directory, let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created. The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

```bash
rm quotes.txt
```

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls quotes.txt
```
```
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```
:::

You can also check by simply executing `ls`

```bash
ls
```


:::{.callout-caution}
### Deleting Is Forever
**The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin** that we can recover deleted
files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,
when we delete files, they are unlinked from the file system so that
their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
file's disk space right away.
:::


:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Using `rm` Safely
What happens when we execute `rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt`?
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
```bash
rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'? y
```
The `-i` option will prompt before (every) removal (use <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm deletion or <kbd>N</kbd> to keep the file).
- The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
- By using the `-i` option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files that we want to remove.
:::
:::::


If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

:::{.callout }
```bash
rm thesis
```
```
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
```
:::

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the 
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

```bash
rm -r thesis
```

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution* (you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).


## Operations with multiple files and directories

Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once. This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames, or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.  


:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** Copy with Multiple Filenames
For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `data-shell/data` directory.
In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

```bash
mkdir backup
cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/
```

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

:::{.callout}
```bash
ls -F
```
```
amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  
pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
```
:::

```bash
cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt 
```

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must be the last argument), `cp` copies the files to the named directory. If given three file names, `cp` throws an error such as the one below, because it is expecting a directory name as the last argument.

```
cp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory
```
:::
:::::


### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

#### Wildcards
:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## *
`*` is a **wildcard**, which matches zero or more  characters.
Let's consider the `data-shell/molecules` directory:
`*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
`pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## ?
`?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas
`*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.
:::

Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.

When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory
(which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.

However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.


:::::{.callout-important icon=false}
## ***Exercise:*** List filenames matching a pattern
When run in the `molecules` directory, which `ls` command(s) will
produce this output?

`ethane.pdb   methane.pdb`

1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
2. `ls *t?ne.*`
3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
4. `ls ethane.*`

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***
The answer is `3.`

`1.` shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (`*`) followed by the letter `t`, then zero or more characters (`*`) followed by `ane.pdb`. This gives `ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb`. 

`2.` shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) followed by the letter `t`, then a single character (`?`), then `ne.` followed by zero or more characters (`*`). This will give us `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` but doesn't match anything which ends in `thane.pdb`.

`3.` fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (`??`) between `t` and `ne`. This is the solution.

`4.` only shows files starting with `ethane.`.

## ***Exercise:*** Reproduce a folder structure
You're starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called '2016-05-18',
which contains a `data` folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of the `2016-05-18-data` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

	2016-05-20/
	└── data
	    ├── processed
	    └── raw

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do? Try them out in the `data-shell` directory.

### 1.
```bash
mkdir 2016-05-20
mkdir 2016-05-20/data
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

### 2.
```bash
mkdir 2016-05-20
cd 2016-05-20
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir raw processed
```

### 3.
```bash
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

### 4.
```bash
mkdir 2016-05-20
cd 2016-05-20
mkdir data
mkdir raw processed
```

## ***Solution:***
The first two sets of commands achieve this objective.
The first set uses relative paths to create the top level directory before
the subdirectories.

The third set of commands will give an error because `mkdir` won't create a subdirectory of a non-existant directory: the intermediate level folders must be created first.

The final set of commands generates the 'raw' and 'processed' directories at the same level as the 'data' directory.
