## 6.1 Background

There are two approaches for genome assembly: reference-based (or comparative)  or *de novo*.  In a reference-based assembly, we use a reference genome as a guide to map our sequence data to and thus reassemble our sequence this way (this is what we did in the previous module).  Alternatively, we can create a 'new' (*de novo*) assembly that does not rely on a map or reference and more closely reflects the actual genome structure of the isolate that was sequenced.

### Genome assemblers

Several tools are available for *de novo* genome assembly depending on whether you're trying to assemble short-read sequence data, long reads or else a combination of both.  Two of the most commonly used assemblers for short-read Illumina data are `Velvet` and `SPAdes`.  SPAdes has become the *de facto* standard de novo genome assembler for Illumina whole genome sequencing data of bacteria and is a major improvement over previous assemblers like Velvet. However, some of its components can be slow and it traditionally did not handle overlapping paired-end reads well.  `Shovill` is a pipeline which uses `SPAdes` at its core, but alters the steps before and after the primary assembly step to get similar results in less time. Shovill also supports other assemblers like `SKESA`, `Velvet` and `Megahit`.

Before we start performing any assemblies, let's pause and check the space of our current working directory as we did for our previous lesson.

You can do this with the **d**isk **u**sage `du` command
```bash
du -h
```

Now, keep this value in mind, and this time, don't forget it. We will come back to it at the end of this chapter.

## 6.4 Assembly quality assessment

### Assembly QC with [`QUAST`](https://quast.sourceforge.net/)

Before we do any further analyses with our assemblies, we need to assess the quality.  To do this we use a tool called `QUAST` which generates a number of useful metrics for assemblies.  These include but aren't limited to:

1. The total number of contigs greater than 0 bp.  Ideally, we like to see assemblies in the smallest number of contigs ('pieces') as this means there is likely less missing data contained in gaps between contigs.
2. The total length of the assembly.  We normally know what the expected length of our assembly is (for more diverse organisms like *E. coli* there may be a range of genome sizes). The length of your assembly should be close to the expected genome size.  If it's too big or too small, either there is some kind of contamination or else you've sequenced the wrong species!
3. The N50 of the assembly.  This is the final metric often used to assess the quality of an assembly.  The N50 is typically calculated by averaging the length of the largest contigs that account for 50% of the genome size. This is a bit more complicated conceptually but the higher the N50 the better.  A large N50 implies that you have a small number of larger contigs in your assembly which equals a good assembly.

Let's activate the `quast` environment:

```bash
conda activate quast
```

### ***Exercise 6.1.1:*** Investigate the QUAST output
Now that we've got the results from `QUAST`, how good is the assembly we created with `shovill`?

1. What is the total number of contigs?
2. What is the total length of the assembly?
3. What is the N50 of the assembly?

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
### ***Solution:***
There are a couple of ways we could answer the questions above as the assembly metrics can be parsed in different ways.  Let's parse the `report.tsv`:

```bash
cat report.tsv
```

This will provide all the information we need:

```bash
Assembly	ERX1275297_ERR1203055_contigs
# contigs (>= 0 bp)	227
# contigs (>= 1000 bp)	86
# contigs (>= 5000 bp)	61
# contigs (>= 10000 bp)	55
# contigs (>= 25000 bp)	48
# contigs (>= 50000 bp)	35
Total length (>= 0 bp)	4397844
Total length (>= 1000 bp)	4361978
Total length (>= 5000 bp)	4311192
Total length (>= 10000 bp)	4270901
Total length (>= 25000 bp)	4162429
Total length (>= 50000 bp)	3732349
# contigs	105
Largest contig	298563
Total length	4376331
GC (%)	65.58
N50	99158
N75	64010
L50	15
L75	28
# N's per 100 kbp	0.00
```

1. The total number of contigs > 0bp is `227`
2. The total length of the assembly is `4397844`
3. The N50 of the assembly is `99158`

What do you think? Should we move forward with this assembly? The answer is yes!

Finally, deactivate the `quast` environment:

```bash
mamba deactivate
```

## 6.5 Genome annotation

Genome annotation is a multi-level process that includes prediction of protein-coding genes (CDSs), as well as other functional genome units such as structural RNAs, tRNAs, small RNAs, pseudogenes, control regions, direct and inverted repeats, insertion sequences, transposons and other mobile elements.  The most commonly used tools for annotating bacterial genomes are `prokka` and, more recently, `Bakta`.  Both use a tool called `prodigal` to predict the protein-coding regions along with other tools for predicting other genomic features such as `Aragorn` for tRNA.  Once the genomic regions have been predicted, the tools use a database of existing bacterial genome annotations, normally generated from a large collection of genomes such as UniRef, to add this information to your genome.

### Annotation with [`Bakta`](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta)

`Bakta` is a tool for the rapid & standardized annotation of bacterial genomes and plasmids from both isolates and MAGs (Metagenome assembled genomes).  It was designed with `prokka` as a template but adds several features such as predicting pseudogenomes and additional annotations (COG, KEGG, AMR) that aren't part of `prokka`.  As `prokka` is no longer being actively supported, there is a move to replacing it with `Bakta` in our analysis pipelines.

Before we run `Bakta` we need to download and set up the database `Bakta` will use to annotate our genome.  Given the size of the database, for the purposes of this course, we've already done this.  However, if you'd like to download and update the database yourself, there are instructions on the [Setup](../../setup.md) page.

First, let's activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate bakta
```

:::{.callout}
## Run Bakta

Let's run `Bakta` on the genome we created earlier to do produce annotation files for this sample:

```bash
bakta --prefix ERX1275297_ERR1203055 --db /home/ajv37/rds/hpc-work/databases/db ERX1275297_ERR1203055_contigs.fa
```

```bash
parse genome sequences...
	imported: 227
	filtered & revised: 227
	contigs: 227

start annotation...
predict tRNAs...
...
```

The following files will be created:

| Output file | Description |
|:-- | :---------- |

### ***Exercise 6.1.2:*** Investigate the Bakta output

We can extract summary statistics for `Bakta` by examining the output files.

1. How many coding regions (CDS) did `Bakta` predict?
2. How many pseudogenes were identified?
3. What was the coding density?

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
### ***Solution:***

The easiest way to pull out the summary statistics is to examine the `ERX1275297_ERR1203055.txt` file:

```bash
cat ERX1275297_ERR1203055.txt
```

```bash
Sequence(s):
Length: 4397844
Count: 227
GC: 65.6
N50: 99158
N ratio: 0.0
coding density: 89.7

Annotation:
tRNAs: 46
tmRNAs: 1
rRNAs: 3
ncRNAs: 20
ncRNA regions: 13
CRISPR arrays: 3
CDSs: 4082
pseudogenes: 19
hypotheticals: 365
signal peptides: 0
sORFs: 2
gaps: 0
oriCs: 2
oriVs: 0
oriTs: 0

Bakta:
Software: v1.6.1
Database: v4.0
DOI: 10.1099/mgen.0.000685
URL: github.com/oschwengers/bakta
```

1. `bakta` predicted 4082 CDSs in ERX1275297_ERR1203055
2. 19 pseudogenes were identified
3. The coding density was 89.7

Finally, deactivate the `bakta` environment:

```bash
mamba deactivate
```

<details><summary>Disk Usage II --- Cleaning up after analysis</summary>
Now that we are done investigating our assembling and annotating our genome, let's pause again and check the space of our current working directory.

You can do this with the **d**isk **u**sage `du` command
```bash
du -h
```

How much disk space have you used since the start of the analysis?
