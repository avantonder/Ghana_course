### Learning Objectives:
- Learn where the output files created by nf-core/bactmap are located.
- Understand the output files created by nf-core/bactmap.
- Learn how to interpret a MultiQC summary and make a decision whether to exclude poor quality samples.
- Understand that nf-core/bactmap produces a lot of intermediate files which take up space and can be deleted once the pipeline has run successfully.

### Keypoints:
- nf-core/bactmap allows you to easily produce a sequence alignment by aligning sequences to a reference genome in a reproducible, documentable fashion

### nf-core/bactmap results

Yesterday, we left nf-core/bactmap running.  Now, we can look at the output directory (`results/bactmap`) to see the various directories containing output files created by `nf-core/bactmap`.

```bash
cd results/bactmap/bactmap_results

ls
```

You should see the following:

```bash
bwa  fastp  multiqc  pipeline_info  pseudogenomes  rasusa  samtools  snpsites  variants 
```
The directories in `results/bactmap/bactmap_results` contain the following:

- `bwa/index` contains the index of the reference sequence
- `fastp` contains the results of the trimming and adapter removal performed by `fastp`
- `fastqc` contains QC metrics for the fastq files generated with `fastQC`
- `multiqc` contains a html file containing summaries of the various outputs
- `pipeline_info` contains information about the pipeline run
- `pseudogenomes` contains consensus fasta files for each sample which have the sample variants compared to the reference included.  The alignment we'll use for the next step can also be found in this directory (`aligned_pseudogenomes.fas`)
- `rasusa` contains the subsampled post-trimmed fastq files
- `samtools` contains the sorted bam files and indices created by `bwa` and `samtools` as part of the mapping process
- `snpsites` contains a variant alignment file created from `aligned_pseudogenomes.fas` that can be used as input for tree inference tools
- `variants` contains filtered `vcf` files which contain the variants for each sample

### The MultiQC summary report

The first thing we'll check is the `html` report file created by `MultiQC`.  Copy this to your desktop:

```bash
cp results/bactmap/bactmap_results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html Desktop
```

Go to `File Explorer`, navigate to your Desktop and double click on `multiqc_report.html`.  This will open the file in your web browser of choice:

#### General statistics

Let's go through each section starting with the `General Statistics`:

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC General Statistics](../fig/bactmap_general_stats.png)

This is a compilation of statistics collected from the outputs of tools such as fastp, samtools and BCFtools.  Sequencing metrics such as the % of duplicated reads and GC content of the reads are shown alongside the results of the mapping (% reads mapped, num). This is a useful way of quickly identifying samples that are of lower quality or perhaps didn't map very well due to species contamination. 

#### fastp

There are a number of plots showing the results of the fastp step in the pipeline.  The first shows the results of the read filtering step where reads are trimmed, adapters removed and low quality reads are thrown out.  The reads that passed this step are highlighted in blue.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp filtered reads](../fig/bactmap_fastp_filtered.png)

The second plot shows the frequency of duplicated reads in each sample.  If you hover over the plot around 1 on the x-axis you'll see that the majority of reads in each sample only appear once.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp duplicated reads](../fig/bactmap_fastp_duplication.png)

The third plot shows the distribution of insert sizes for each set of sequence files.  As we've included data sequenced on different Illumina platforms with different library construction protocols, there's a mix of insert sizes.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp insert sizes](../fig/bactmap_fastp_insert_sizes.png)

The next plot shows the average sequence quality across the reads in each sample. You can see we have drop offs in quality at the beginning and end of reads; this is pretty typical and is an artefact of the sequencing process.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp sequence quality](../fig/bactmap_fastp_sequence_quality.png)

The fifth plot shows the average GC content across the reads in each sample.  As you might expect, the average GC content is conserved across all the samples as they are all from the same organism (MTB).

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp GC](../fig/bactmap_fastp_GC.png)

The final fastp plot shows the average N content across the reads in each sample.  Similar to what we see in the sequence quality plot, the number of Ns tends to increase towards the end of reads.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC fastp N's](../fig/bactmap_fastp_N.png)

#### Samtools

The plots in this section are created from the results of running `samtool stats` on the sorted bam files produce during the mapping process.  The first shows the number or percentage of reads that mapped to the reference.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC samtools mapping](../fig/bactmap_samtools_mapping.png)

The second plot shows the overall alignment metrics for each sample.  Hover over each dot to see more detailed information.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC samtools alignment](../fig/bactmap_samtools_alignment.png)

#### BCFtools

The plots in this section provide information about the variants called using `bcftools`.  The first plot shows the numbers or percentage of each type of variant in each sample.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC bcftools variants](../fig/bactmap_bcftools_variants.png)

The second plot shows the quality of each variant called by `bcftools`. The majority of variants in each sample are high quality.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC bcftools variant quality](../fig/bactmap_bcftools_variant_quality.png)

The third plot shows the distribution of lengths of Indels (insertions are positive values and deletions are negative values).  This is useful information to have, but in practice we tend to exclude indels when building alignments for phylogenetic tree building.

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC bcftools indel distribution](../fig/bactmap_bcftools_indel_distribution.png)

The final bcftools plot shows the distribution of the number of reads mapping to each variant position and is one of the metrics used to filter out low quality variants (the fewer the reads mapping to a variant position, the lower the confidence we have that the variant is in fact real).

![nf-core/bactmap MultiQC bcftools variant depth](../fig/bactmap_bcftools_variant_depth.png)

#### Software versions

This section of the report shows the software run as part of nf-core/bactmap and the versions used.  This is particularly important when reproducing the analysis on a different system or when writing the methods section of a paper.

### ***Exercise:*** Extract data from MultiQC report

1. How many reads in sample SRX8022206 passed the fastp filtering step?
2. How many reads in sample SRX8038977 mapped to the reference genome?
3. How many A->G variants were called in sample SRX8038976?
4. Which version of samtools does the nf-core/bactmap pipeline use?

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
### ***Solution:***

1. 2148657 reads passed the fastp filtering step
2. 3685855 reads mapped to the reference genome
3. 107 (8.9%) A->G variants were called by `bcftools`
4. The version of samtools used in the pipeline is `1.10`

### The pseudogenomes directory

This directory contains the files that are most useful for our downstream analyses (at least for now).  Change to the directory and list the files:

```bash
cd bactmap_results/pseudogenomes

ls
```

You will see the pseudogenome fasta files for each sample, 

### The work directory

Each step of the pipeline produces one or more files that are not save to the results directory but are kept in the work directory.  This means that if, for whatever reason, the pipeline doesn't finish successfully you can resume it.  However, once the pipeline has completed successfully, you no longer need this directory (it can take up a lot of space) so you can delete it:

```bash
rm -rf work
```
