# Introduction to Bacterial Genomics

## Overview 

This course will teach you how to analyse sequencing data from bacterial isolates.

### Learning Objectives

- List course learning objectives here.
- These describe concepts the learners should grasp and techniques they should be able to use by the end of the course.
- You can think of these as completing the phrase "after this course, the participant should be able to..."
- They are not supposed to be as detailed as the learning objectives of each section, but more high-level.
:::


### Target Audience

This course is aimed at life scientists interested in the bioinformatic analysis of bacterial genomes.

### Prerequisites

We assume no prior bioinformatics experience or experience with the tools introduced in this course.  An elementary knowledge of molecular and bacterial biology is assumed (concepts such as: DNA, RNA, SNPs).
